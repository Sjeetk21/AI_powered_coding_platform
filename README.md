# AI-Powered Coding Challenge Platform

## Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered coding challenge platform where users can participate in coding challenges that are dynamically generated and assessed in real-time. The platform evaluates users' submissions based on their correctness, efficiency, and coding style, providing immediate feedback and showcasing a leaderboard to highlight top performers.

## Objective

- **Real-time challenge generation**: Automatically generate coding challenges tailored to users' skill levels.
- **AI-based assessment**: Evaluate users' submitted code in real-time for correctness, efficiency, and style.
- **Leaderboard**: Display rankings based on challenge completion time and performance.
- **Instant feedback**: Offer real-time feedback on code submissions to help users improve their skills.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js
- **AI/ML models**: For automatic challenge generation and code assessment.
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js

## Features

- **Challenge Generation**: The platform uses AI/ML algorithms to create coding challenges suitable for varying skill levels.
- **AI Assessment**: Submitted code is assessed on multiple aspects such as correctness, performance, and code style.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays the top performers based on their challenge-solving speed and quality of code.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant feedback is provided to users after code submission, helping them to improve their coding abilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js or Python (depending on the backend technology you choose).
2. Basic understanding of React/Vue.js for the frontend.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
